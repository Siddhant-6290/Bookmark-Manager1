#Challenges faced
as the technologies/stack were new for me so it was a little bit challenging for me , but as i had a prior basic knowledge of web dev so i was able to solve them, i also took help of various ai tools,people to debug the errors, and due to time constrain i was not able to understand the project fully,but heres what i tried.
There was a error with taileind.config file,there were errors in globals.css

#learnings
As this stack was a bit new for me i understood why and how they are used,why next.js is used and how to use tailwind as initally i used to use normal css only,it was a very limited time so i tried my best to learn the things
